    comment: "So many stars!!!! Nikki's place was one of the best airbnbs we've ever had the privilege of staying at! It is so much more spectacular than the photos show! Nikki OFFERED us early check in and she was easy and lovely to communicate with! The place was beyond perfect clean and smelled like a dream! The outdoor area offered a magical refuge for relaxation and delightful dinner. Nikki's place is close to so many outdoor and dining activities! If available, you should already be hitting the reservation button! 100out of 10! We can't wait to come back! Can't say enough good things about our stay!",

    location: "Saint Paul, Minnesota",
    comment: "This was the perfect homebase for our Jupiter/Tequesta vacation! We were in the area to visit family and take my young son to the beach. We appreciated the proximity to the wonderful restaurants in Jupiter as well as easy access to area beaches. By night, the patio provided the perfect, private retreat for us to spend time with family members. Nikki was a great host and a proactive communicator. We couldn't recommend this place more!",

    title: "Outstanding house",
    location: "Tampa, Florida",
    comment: "The is an outstanding house, and a perfect spot if folks are looking to be in Jupiter and near the water. For us as scuba divers, all the diving boats are within two miles of the house, which means we do not have to get up at the crack of dawn to spend our weekend diving, and all the good restaurants are within 3 miles of the home. While the images are 100% accurate, the house is somehow even nicer in person. Everything you need is available, and my wife (the clean freak) commented on how clean everything was. We slept in the master bedroom, and had no back issues in the morning. A/C was nice and cold (a plus for floridians), and the backyard is a great spot to unwind with friends. Nikki knew it was my wife's birthday, and left her a little surprise in the fridge....very nice touch! As Tampa residents who cross the state often, this is now our go to home when staying in Jupiter. 10 stars!",
